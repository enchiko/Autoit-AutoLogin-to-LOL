Program needs 2 txt files.
  1. password.txt
  2. id.txt

id = username which has to be insert in first box in lol client
password = your password, second textbox in lol client


First PixelSearch is position of username textbox (+ litte bit of padding) and black color of it (0x000306)
Second PixelSearch is position of LOGIN STATUS (textblock) after your program press ENTER. (program will check if LOGIN STATUS textblock appears, then program will stops)

!! This application may have some bugs so here I put in first line wrote HotKeySet to "F1" !!
if something happened you can stop the program by pressing F1

After sucessful login, it will automatically stops the program.
